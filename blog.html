	<h2>TUTORIAL // USING SMART OBJECTS TO CREATE MOCKUPS IN PHOTOSHOP</h2>
	
	<h3>JUNE NINETEENTH, TWENTY FIFTEEN</h3>


		<p>As I mentioned in my previous blog post, I've decided to sprinkle in some tutorials here and there just to keep things interesting. Actually, in reality, I did a lot of my design learning by looking for tutorials and posts like these to accomplish whatever task I happened to have at hand. Strangely enough, more often than not I would usually end up just trying to figure stuff out on my own, which I EXTREMELY encourage you to do. The software used for design is complex, and full of idiosyncrasies that can really only be found through your own exploration. That having been said, I realize that sometimes that just doesn't cut it, so hopefully the tutorials I post will be straightforward enough for a beginner to use, and technical enough to teach you how to do it from here on out. I'm just trying to teach the things I had to learn on my own.</p>

		<p>First ups! Mock ups! What ups!</p>

		<p>Now, one of the greatest tools I have found in my experience of working with clients is that its hard for people to visualize the implementation of a design. Yeah, a logo can look great on paper, but there really is something EXCITING about seeing it on a screen, shirt, or billboard. Obviously you can't always rent a billboard to provide a proof of concept for your client, but with a little Photoshop magic, mock-ups can come to your aid and rescue.</p>

		<p>The best way about doing it the way I'm going to show you is that we'll essentially create it in a way that allows you use it for forever after. None of this one and done bull. Once you create a mock up for, lets say an iPhone 6 Plus, you'll have that and be able to swap out designs for the eternities that follow.</p>

		<p>So, fire up ye old Photoshop, and lets get started.</p>

		<p>Okay, so here is the image I want to mock up. Its a re-imagining of the iPhone home screen, if it was running old school Mac OS, because why not? (We'll talk about pixel art at a future date.) </p>

		<img src="blog/mockup/1.png" class="blogimage50" alt="">

		<p>If at all possible, the earlier you determine the dimensions or ratio of your screen/billboard/area, the easier its going to be to design for that space, AND for creating the objects needed in Photoshop down the road. I know what the dimensions of an iPhone 6 + are, so I designed to fit that restraint. If possible I STRONGLY suggest you do the same.</p>

		<p>Open Photoshop, and the image you want to create your mock up with.</p> 

		<img src="blog/mockup/2.png" class="blogimage50" alt="">

		<p>I lifted this one straight from Apple's website, but high resolution photos of pretty much anything you would want to mock up exist. Find them, and open them in Photoshop. Once that ish is open, grab yourself the shape tool, and draw a rectangle. If you know the dimensions you're working with (WHICH YOU SHOULD), you can click once, type in the increments, and BAM, scale that sucker to fit.</p>

		<p>In case you haven't figure it out, we're going to draw a box or object over the screen we wish to mock up.</p>

		<img src="blog/mockup/3.png" class="blogimagesingle" alt="">

		<p>After you've got your rectangle drawn, you're going to head over to the layers menu and left (or command) click the layer that is your shape. You will select "Convert to Smart Object."</p>

		<img src="blog/mockup/4.png" class="blogimagesingle" alt="">

		<p>Once you've got your smart object officially created, you're going to tweak it to fit whatever it is you're trying to mock up. For this example, I was able to do it with a simple "Skew."</p>

		<img src="blog/mockup/5.png" class="blogimagesingle" alt="">
		<img src="blog/mockup/6.png" class="blogimagesingle" alt="">
		<img src="blog/mockup/7.png" class="blogimagesingle" alt="">

		<p>After you've done all of that, it should look something like this:</p>

		<img src="blog/mockup/8.png" class="blogimagesingle" alt="">

		<p>Here's where the magic happens! Left click your smart object layer, and select "Edit Contents."</p>

		<img src="blog/mockup/9.png" class="blogimagesingle" alt="">

		<p>Thats going to open up a new canvas, which should look like this.</p>

		<img src="blog/mockup/10.png" class="blogimagesingle" alt="">

		<p>So, in very general terms, when you create a Smart Object, you're essentially creating a canvas on top of your canvas. Or something.</p>

		<p>Anyway, at this point, you're going to paste, place, or embed whatever it is you want to use for your mockup. Make sure to turn off the layer that has the border from your shape, if you have one.</p>

		<img src="blog/mockup/11.png" class="blogimagesingle" alt="">

		<p>You'll save this canvas, and go back to your original mock up. I'm not sure why, but I took a picture of this when I did it, so I might as well use it I guess.</p>

		<img src="blog/mockup/12.png" class="blogimagesingle" alt="">

		<p>Ka-ching! Look at that wonderfulness! You've got yourself a pretty decent mock up, friend.</p>

		<img src="blog/mockup/13.png" class="blogimagesingle" alt="">

		<p>If your screen has any sort of glare, go ahead and recreate it, if possible. Even if you don't, you've got a mock up good enough to send most clients to give them some contextual ideas.</p>

		<img src="blog/mockup/14.png" class="blogimagesingle" alt="">

		<p>The best part? You can just save this, and swap out the contents of your smart object any time you need to mock something up. Seriously! Its that easy! And it makes pretty much anything you do look a KAJILLION times better.</p>

		<p>Thats how you use a Smart Object in Photoshop to create a mock up template that you'll be able to use to look like a freaking pro whenever you need to.</p>

		<p>Use this power responsibly! I know I try to...</p>

	<h2>A LIFE OF DESIGN</h2>
	
	<h3>JUNE EIGHTEENTH, TWENTY FIFTEEN</h3>

		<p>What is one of the first questions you get asked when someone inquires as to your profession? "Why did you decide to become XXXXX?" "What made you want to do XXXXX for the rest of your life?" If you're lucky, you get asked "Why would anyone in their right mind want to do XXXXX?"</p>

		<p>I was not an Art guy in high school. Any and all of my friends, colleagues, or acquaintences will tell you straight up that I was a music guy through and through. I graduated high school, and was still a music guy. I was going to become a music teacher and compose film scores on the side. I wanted to be Mr. Holland, but without the gross cheating on my wife with a high schooler thing. Props if you understand that sentence.</p>

		<p>I was maybe three-quarters of my way through my freshman year at Southern Utah University and deep into their music program. I was there on a music scholarship, 80 percent of my classes were based around music theory, I had been in two (yes TWO) operas, and I had multiple music lessons each week. My life was music! This is what I had dreamed about! This is what I wanted!</p>

		<p>Or so I thought.</p>

		<p>Now, don't get me wrong, there is still a corner of my heart dedicated to music. I try to practice the guitar for a half hour every day, and I have more text books on my bookshelf about Jazz theory than anyone should. But, when you find yourself more interested in the patterns on the ceiling than song you're supposed to be singing, or find yourself lingering on the logo when you should be sight=reading, or collecting the posters from each concert you performed in not because you performed in them but because you thought they would look bitchin in your dorm; it might be time to reevaluate.</p>

		<p>I took a break from school after that. Met the love of my life, had some... interesting jobs, got married, and somehow at the end of all of that found myself in a Graphic Designer position with a sizable portfolio. There are of course a lot of steps and a lot of pivots on the way to now, but you get the idea. Life brought me here.</p>

		<p>So, when someone asks me why I decided to become a designer, I'm not sure what to tell them. I got here by accident? Secretly its what I always wanted to be? For a long time I wasn't really able to give someone a straight answer. Until I figured it out, and now heaven help the poor soul who asks me. In fact, recently I became the Design and Print Manager for Dixie State University, and while a group of us were away for some training someone asked me this question. What happened afterwards can only be described as an hour long monologue. Whoops.</p>

		<p>So. Why do I design? Because design is EVERYTHING.</p>

		<p>There is not a single thing man-made that was not designed by someone else. Someone you have never met, and someone will never know the name of. Big things like cars and airplanes and buildings, and small things like the way the last book read was bound and the kind of weave in the carpet under your feet and the exact rounded angle of the doorknob you just used. If you're a religious person, I think it would be safe to say that God is a designer. Everything in your life has been influenced by design. You know how to navigate this blog, not because someone sat there and told you how to scroll down, but because someone figured out a long time ago how to design scrolling a webpage an almost instinctual reaction.</p>

		<p>How do you not get excited by that prospect? We are all interconnected by design. Why wouldn't I want to take part in that. The chance to create a piece of someone else world is exhilarating! The ability to translate someone else's needs, desires, or ideas into a tangible and visual medium is intoxicating! I cannot convey to you how excited this makes me feel when I think about it. </p>

		<p>When I was a kid, and played the insanely awesome "Tony Hawk: Pro Skater 2" on my righteous Nintendo 64, I always spent more time on the character creation screen than actually playing the game. In retrospect, things like that should have probably tipped me off. But hey, I'm here now so lets roll with it.</p>

		<p>I don't love art, I don't love layout, I don't love typography. I love when all of those things and more are combined into design. I can say without hesitation that I love design.</p>

		<p>So, thats what this blog is for. My love letters (and maybe a few hate letters, I'm looking at you Microsoft Edge logo) to the craft. I might throw a tutorial up, or talk about other things, like how great that movie was, or how much I love this new album or whatever. But, for the most part, all posts will be about one thing.</p>

		<p>All roads lead to design.</p>
