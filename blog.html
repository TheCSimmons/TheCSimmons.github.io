	<h2>Kimball Hafen Maternity Photos</h2>
	<h3>APRIL ELEVENTH, TWENTY FIFTEEN</h3>
	<img class="blogimagesingle" src="blogimages/1 copy.jpg">
	<p>I had the opportunity to flex my photography muscles this weekend (something I don't get to do as often as I would like). It reminded me how much I enjoy trying to capture candid moments, and why I picked up a camera in the first place. The weather was great, the light was good, and I think the pictures came out fantastically.</p>
	<img class="blogimagesingle" src="blogimages/3 copy.jpg">
	<p>I bought a new lens a few weeks ago, and hadn't really had a chance to try it out. I was super stoked when this opportunity came up, and let me take it for a spin. It was wonderful! I love that thing!</p>

	<p>One thing that I really like about photography, is that you really just have one chance to get THAT picture. Sure, you can blast a dozen picture within a second, but getting THE picture is hard work, and requires timing that just isn't present in my normal day to day design.</p>
	<p>When you design something, you usually make revision after revision after revision until its perfect. Not so much with photography. I guess what I am trying to say is that design feels more like a play you've rehearsed for weeks, and photography is more like improv on the fly. Both are great, and not everyone can do both, but I sure enjoy the attempt.</p>
	<p>Did you know that I have been in THREE operas in my lifetime? Crazy. I'll save that for another blog post.</p>

	<h2>New "Promotional" Video</h2>
	<h3>APRIL FOURTH, TWENTY FIFTEEN</h3>
	<p>Somehow I ended up with some spare time this week. I know! I'm not sure how it happened either, but it did. So, after watching a bunch of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PMK1M7ZxJc" target="_blank">Aaron Draplin</a> videos about design, I decided to make one for myself, because why not?</p>
		<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GvbmGGxwIeA?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	<p>I know it ain't much, but I like it a lot. That might not say a lot because it is coming from me, but whatever. I think I'll embed it on my website, instead of the super lame "under construction" banner I have up right now. I might leave it there after the site is up. I am that proud of it.</p>
	<p>One of the hardest things about being a freelance graphic designer is not only getting your name heard, but getting it remembered. This video, I guess, is my attempt at being remembered. I might just throw this out into the world wild web and see what happens.</p>
	<p>Yep, lets do that.</p>

	<h2>I quit.</h2>
	<h3>APRIL FIRST, TWENTY FIFTEEN</h3>
	<p>I QUIT. Working as a designer is too hard, and I don't want to do it anymore.</p>
	<p>Just kidding, happy April Fools day.</p>

	<h2>New Site, New Blog</h2>
	<h3>MARCH 28, TWENTY FIFTEEN</h3>
	<p>I bought my first domain name today. That was weird. But sh!t, it was 99 cents!</p>
	<p>For a while I've known that I would need to build a website for myself. I have tried websites like wordpress, and square space, and behance, and blah and blah, and whatever. I don't know if its the designer in me, or some deep dark supressed control freak deep within my soul that just can't do it with those. I have to know that I can customize how my website looks, HOWEVER I CHOOSE. Maybe I'm just picky. Maybe I'm a control freak. Let's hope for the former.</p>
	<p>Anyway, long story slightly less long, I decided to teach myself how to build websites. Thanks to my good friend <a href="http://catskull.net/">David</a>, two books by Jon Duckett, and a thirst for knowledge, I was able to scrape togetherthis bad boy you see before you.</p>
	<p>So, this is where my blog will be. Check it at your convenience.</p>
	<p>Welcome aboard.</p>
