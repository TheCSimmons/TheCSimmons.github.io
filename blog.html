	<h2>A LIFE OF DESIGN</h2>
	
	<h3>JUNE EIGHTEENTH, TWENTY FIFTEEN</h3>

		<p>What is one of the first questions you get asked when someone inquires as to your profession? "Why did you decide to become XXXXX?" "What made you want to do XXXXX for the rest of your life?" If you're lucky, you get asked "Why would anyone in their right mind want to do XXXXX?"</p>

		<p>I was not an Art guy in high school. Any and all of my friends, colleagues, or acquaintences will tell you straight up that I was a music guy through and through. I graduated high school, and was still a music guy. I was going to become a music teacher and compose film scores on the side. I wanted to be Mr. Holland, but without the gross cheating on my wife with a high schooler thing. Props if you understand that sentence.</p>

		<p>I was maybe three-quarters of my way through my freshman year at Southern Utah University and deep into their music program. I was there on a music scholarship, 80 percent of my classes were based around music theory, I had been in two (yes TWO) operas, and I had multiple music lessons each week. My life was music! This is what I had dreamed about! This is what I wanted!</p>

		<p>Or so I thought.</p>

		<p>Now, don't get me wrong, there is still a corner of my heart dedicated to music. I try to practice the guitar for a half hour every day, and I have more text books on my bookshelf about Jazz theory than anyone should. But, when you find yourself more interested in the patterns on the ceiling than song you're supposed to be singing, or find yourself lingering on the logo when you should be sight=reading, or collecting the posters from each concert you performed in not because you performed in them but because you thought they would look bitchin in your dorm; it might be time to reevaluate.</p>

		<p>I took a break from school after that. Met the love of my life, had some... interesting jobs, got married, and somehow at the end of all of that found myself in a Graphic Designer position with a sizable portfolio. There are of course a lot of steps and a lot of pivots on the way to now, but you get the idea. Life brought me here.</p>

		<p>So, when someone asks me why I decided to become a designer, I'm not sure what to tell them. I got here by accident? Secretly its what I always wanted to be? For a long time I wasn't really able to give someone a straight answer. Until I figured it out, and now heaven help the poor soul who asks me. In fact, recently I became the Design and Print Manager for Dixie State University, and while a group of us were away for some training someone asked me this question. What happened afterwards can only be described as an hour long monologue. Whoops.</p>

		<p>So. Why do I design? Because design is EVERYTHING.</p>

		<p>There is not a single thing man-made that was not designed by someone else. Someone you have never met, and someone will never know the name of. Big things like cars and airplanes and buildings, and small things like the way the last book read was bound and the kind of weave in the carpet under your feet and the exact rounded angle of the doorknob you just used. If you're a religious person, I think it would be safe to say that God is a designer. Everything in your life has been influenced by design. You know how to navigate this blog, not because someone sat there and told you how to scroll down, but because someone figured out a long time ago how to design scrolling a webpage an almost instinctual reaction.</p>

		<p>How do you not get excited by that prospect? We are all interconnected by design. Why wouldn't I want to take part in that. The chance to create a piece of someone else world is exhilarating! The ability to translate someone else's needs, desires, or ideas into a tangible and visual medium is intoxicating! I cannot convey to you how excited this makes me feel when I think about it. </p>

		<p>When I was a kid, and played the insanely awesome "Tony Hawk: Pro Skater 2" on my righteous Nintendo 64, I always spent more time on the character creation screen than actually playing the game. In retrospect, things like that should have probably tipped me off. But hey, I'm here now so lets roll with it.</p>

		<p>I don't love art, I don't love layout, I don't love typography. I love when all of those things and more are combined into design. I can say without hesitation that I love design.</p>

		<p>So, thats what this blog is for. My love letters (and maybe a few hate letters, I'm looking at you Microsoft Edge logo) to the craft. I might throw a tutorial up, or talk about other things, like how great that movie was, or how much I love this new album or whatever. But, for the most part, all posts will be about one thing.</p>

		<p>All roads lead to design.</p>
