			<center><div class="info">
				<p>Hello! My name is Colton Simmons Campbell, and I make things.
					<br><br>I've spent a lot of time doing a lot of things over the last ten or so years, but the hat I've worn most often is the one that says <i>"Graphic Designer"</i> in a really cool font with a simple yet tasteful icon. It came with the beard and glasses.
					<br><br>My expertise is in brand development and messaging. I've done everything from logo to web to print to clothing design, copywriting, content strategy, adwords, music composition, photography, and I've also tried my hand at carpentry. <i>Yeah. It's been a busy ten years.</i>
					<br><br>Anyway, here is what you need to know: I am here to help you. Whatever you need, we can work together to make something amazing. Let's chat.
					<br><br>Feel free to shoot me <a href="mailto:thecscd@gmail.com">an email</a>, or hit me up through any form of social media you see fit.

			<center><div class="info">
				<p>If there is one thing that I can claim as a "specialty," it's branding. I've done everything from getting startups off the ground, to assisting the complete rebrand of a university. Coming up with solutions to branding problems and maintaining a consistent identity is something I am truly passionate about. No joke, this stuff gets me super excited.
				<br><br>Below are a few examples of my work. You can view a more complete portfolio <a href="portfolio.pdf" target="top">here.</a></p>

		<div class="illustrationcontent">
			<center><div class="info">
				<p>What I lack in pencil or paintbrush ability I make up for in mouse skills. I enjoy art, and I enjoy making it. A lot of times, the illustration work I do is for personal enjoyment, but othertimes it's used to assist branding, messgaging, and helping translate ideas to anyone who looks at it. One of my favorite projects was illustrating a childrens book for the Dixie State University rebrand. You can check that out <a href="dsubook.pdf">here.</a> I even helped <a href="https://www.stgeorgeutah.com/news/archive/2017/04/09/dixie-states-trailblazer-branding-receives-national-recognition/#.WvRam9MvyRs" target="top">win a few awards</a> with that one.

		<div class="photographycontent">
			<center><div class="info">
			<p>I am not a mathmatician or science guy, but for some reason the amount of logistical work that goes into the methodology of taking a photo is a sometimes tedious task that I look forward to undertaking every time I pull that bad boy out of its case. Maternity photos, product shoots, proms, births, a day at the park, professional headshots; I can capture whatever look it is you're going for.
				<br><br> In addition to being the occasional photographer myself, I enjoy working with other photographers to make sure all of their client's needs are met. <b>If you're a photographer and want to work with me in some sort of capacity,</b> check out my <a href="photorefer.html">photographer referal program,</a> or shoot me <a href="mailto:thecscd@gmail.com">an email</a>.

				<p>Believe it or not, somehow I've managed to also earn a Bachelors of Science Degree in English with an emphasis on Professional and Technical Writing, with a minor in Visual Design. I've got experience writing content for clients including email blasts, blog posts, and ad copy. I've also worked as an editor in perfecting other people's work, and have contributed to the occasional magazine or news site with my own articles.
				<br><br>You can take a look at some writing samples below. I've picked a few of my favorites, and included a word count so you can know what you're getting yourself into. If you'd like to see more, please feel free to shoot me <a href="mailto:thecscd@gmail.com">an email</a>.
