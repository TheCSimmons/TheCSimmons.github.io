		I have been working as a Graphic Designer for the last 7 years, both in freelance and as an in-house guy at several places. I'm also real experienced at UI/UX, web design, and just over all I've got my stuff together. I can use Maya, Blender, the entire Adobe Suite of products, Sublime Text, and can Google things pretty well. I'm an award winning children's book illustrator, and choreographer. No, really.<br><br>

	Design started as a hobby and pretty quickly turned into work. Photography, music, video editing, website building, fine art, furniture design; I used to do it for fun, and now I do it for fun and money.<br> <br>

	I currently work as a Graphic Designer for Dixie State University, and manage all of the Public Relations for the Student Association there, in addition to my normal freelance work. I am always interested in providing design services for anyone who needs it, whether it be the largest corporation, the smallest mom-and-pop shop, or non-profit organization trying to be heard. Head over to my contact page to get in touch with me. <br><br>

	I married a wonderful woman a little over three years ago, had a daughter one year ago, and in my spare time, you can find me playing guitar, spending time with my family, or rewatching every glorious second of Breaking Bad.
