          <p class="lead mb-5">I'm just a 1L who wants to do right by my other 1L homies. I was born in the mossy woodlands of Southern California, were I learned at the feet of literal giants how to cultivate a socially responsible smattering of skills befit of a knightly wizard - all before the age of 5. At age 6, I convinced my parents to take me across the deserts to live with monks and gypsies where I gained the keys to all six chests of enlightement before my 11th birthday. I'm not allowed to talk about the things a certain government agency asked me to do between the ages of 15 and 18.
          	<br><br>
          	Are you still reading? You're a 1L. Don't you have a case to brief or something?
          	<br><br>
          	Here's the thing. All I want to do is make sure 1Ls are getting what they need. I'll make sure it happens. I'll do whatever you need me to, to make sure this year is a succesful one.

              <p>I sat on the Executive Council as the Vice President of Public Relations. My main job was making sure communication between students and the people that made decisions that affected their education was open and clear. I also did the inverse, making sure students knew what was happening and what was available to them. </p>

              <p>So listen, I'm not gonna get into the specifics, but Dixie State used to have a mascot that was... unsavory. A committee was put together to create a new brand and mascot identity that was... more... savory? I was 1 of 2 student reps whose job was to communicate the desires of the rest of the student population, and to make sure the administration didn't saddle the students with something dumb. Conducted hella surveys, executed a bunch of research, and held more focus groups than I care to ever revisit. It resulted in a new brand and mascot that has been pretty freaking great. I feel like we were pretty succesful.</p>

           <p class="lead mb-5">As easy as it would be to make a bunch of promises about specific things I want to do this year, I'm not going to. I believe that being a representative for the entire class of 2021 means that it's not about what I want, its about what we want. I want to be a voice for 1Ls, and I believe that I can do that better than anyone else, straight up. <br><br>
           I would love to talk to anyone and everyone about the things they want from the Student Bar Association this year. Please don't hesitate to give me a call, shoot me a text, or send me an email if you'd like to chat it up.</p>
